# PAD-project: Event planning application

## 1. Application suitability
 The event planning system is suitable for a microservices architecture because it involves various components, such as user management, event creation, guest invitations, task management, and more, which can be developed and maintained independently. As mentioned, distributed systems allow to scale specific components of the application independently. For example, during a popular event, itâ€™s possible to scale the invitation management service to handle a large number of guest responses without affecting other parts of the application. This ensures that the application remains responsive even during peak usage

### Real world examples
* **WeddingWire:** WeddingWire is an event planning application specifically tailored for weddings. It provides tools for couples to plan their weddings, including finding vendors, managing guest lists, and creating wedding websites.
* **Meetup:** Meetup is a social platform that facilitates event planning and attendance. Users can create and join local interest-based groups and events. It's commonly used for organizing networking events, hobbyist meetups, and community gatherings.

 ## 2. Service boundaries
* **Event management service:** 
  * Create event
  * Update event details
  * Read event by Id
  * Read all events
  * Delete event.

* **Task management service:**
  * Create task
  * Update task
  * Read task by Id
  * Read all tasks assigned to an event
  * Delete task

## 4. Technology stack

**.NET for microservices:** .NET is a strong choice for building microservices due to its comprehensive ecosystem, cross-platform compatibility, performance, developer productivity, and security features. It supports multiple programming languages, offers scalability, and integrates well with other technologies and containerization, making it well-suited for modern microservices architectures.

**MSSQL Database for microservices:** MSSQL provides seamless integration with the .NET ecosystem, high performance, robust security features, and reliability. MSSQL is well-supported by Microsoft's development tools and offers compatibility with industry standards, making it a strong choice for building database-driven applications in the .NET framework.

**Java for API gateway:** Java is a favorable choice for implementing an API gateway due to its maturity (well-established, reliable, and proven over time), scalability, rich ecosystem, and strong security features. Its cross-platform compatibility, community support, and integration capabilities make it a reliable and customizable solution for managing, securing, and routing API requests in a microservices architecture.

## 6. Deployment and scaling
**Docker** is valuable for deployment and scaling due to its containerization technology, providing isolation, portability, and consistency. It enables efficient resource utilization and seamless horizontal scaling using container orchestration tools. Docker's version control, dependency management, and security features further streamline the deployment process, making it a popular choice for modern application development and operations.
